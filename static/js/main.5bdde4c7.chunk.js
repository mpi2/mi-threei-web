An internal study showed that 60% of the tm1a lines were complete knockouts, 16% were hypomorphs and 24% had residual gene activity. By the end of 2014, all lines will be analysed in their tm1b form. The knock-in first approach relies on the identication of a critical exon common to all trascript variants that, when deleted, creates a frame-shift mutation. The critical exon is defined by a computer-assisted procedure and flanked by loxP sites. Upstream, an FRT-flanked lacZ-loxP-neomycin cassette is inserted. The lacZ-loxP-neomycin cassette contains a splice acceptor and also codes for a poly-A tail. In its full-length form (tm1a), the construct therefore generates a null allele by creating a shortened transcript that lacks the critical exon. A lacZ reporter knockout (tm1b) can be generated by exposing mice or cells to Cre recombinase. Alternatively, exposure to Flp recombinase will create a wild type allele (tm1c) which can then be used to create conditional knockout strains by crossing the mice to a tissue-specific Cre-expressing strain. Genes expressed in ES cells are usually targeted with a promoterless construct, genes not expressed with a promoter-driven construct. Promoter-driven constructs carry a slightly higher risk for off-target effects.

The reference range approach has been used extensively by WTSI and 3i, but is currently not available as a test in the IMPC statistical pipeline. The IMPC has therefore analysed the same blood data using a mixed model approach which is less stringent and leads to more hits. Hits in blood immunophenotyping will therefore differ between this webpage and the IMPC webpage. Our approach is more conservative and very unlikely to contain false positive results.
